# ts-library-template

This package is a useful template for setting up a simple typescript library. It's based on https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-create-an-npm-package with a couple of tweaks.

Add into a turbo workspace with:

```sh
turbo gen workspace --copy https://github.com/pwalker/ts-library-template
```
